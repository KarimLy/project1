# Making My Hands Dirty With Git and GitHub

In This repository; I'm trying to discover all the features in Github as well as Git in my labtop and my Desktop too.
Next, is a list of things I beleive that i know now:

* How to creat a repository in Github.
* How to clone a repository from Github to my Git Bash.
* How to fork a repository.
* How to use Fork, Star and Unwatch buttons.
* How to walk through the code tab.
* How to setup my Git (user.name/user.email/core.editor)
* I've learned some commands in Git such as: git init/git clone/list/ls/clear/cd/cd ../echo/remote -v/ git add/git commit/ git status

My next target will be to learn about "merging conflict" status and how to deal with it. Moreover, I'll continue my journey through other tabs in GitHub and learn more commands in the Command Line..."Monster" lol. 

P.S. All the things I've learned so far come from Pro Git Book which I found very easy and smooth to read. Additionally, I've watched some interesting tutorials on Youtube.

So, that's it for today and see you next time.
